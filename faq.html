  <h2 class="question">Why is DiscordSource Unsafe?</h2>
  <p class="answer">Discord Source and BetterDocs are unsafe because the owner, (0mniscient) posts plugins that can make your account vunerable by exposing the token. These include plugins such as Account Switchers, bot logins or token logins. Back about a year ago, he didn't check a plugin for malicious code and posted a token stealer on BetterDocs. We (the BetterDiscord Community) got the blame for the lost accounts. Added to this, he has other plugins that fit the "unsafe" categoy. Plugins such as message loggers, nodeletemessages and other such plugins that would interact with the API are on his site. This wouldn't get your account STOLEN but it is against the API terms, which is something discord takes seriously if broken.</p>
  <br>
</br>
  <h2 class="question">What is the difference between BetterDocs, Discord Source and BetterDiscord?</h2>
  <p class="answer">BetterDocs was a website unaffiliated with BetterDiscord used to distribute themes and plugins. Discord Source is simply a rebranded BetterDocs with a different domain. BetterDiscord is a program used to modify the discord client. BetterDocs and Discord Source are deemed unsafe and misleading, which is why you are reading this FAQ.</p>
<br>
</br>
  <h2 class="question">I still don't get how this is disrespecting the devs.</h2>
  <p class="answer">These sources take our themes and plugins, and post them on the site. It's owner (0mniscient aka Mr. Robot) doesn't ask for permission to do so, he just does it. He even makes fake profiles. The sick thing about this, is that he profits off of our work. A decent theme takes DAYS to make. Even weeks. Larges scale projects like Twitchcord have been in the works for years. Added to this, he refuses our pull requests to get our content taken down. He even banned NFLD (theme dev) from his server for asking.</p>
  <br>
</br>
  <h2 class="question">What does the blocker do in all? Are there any screenshots?</h2>
  <p class="answer">The blocker does the following:</p>
  <li>Displays a warning whenever a link to BetterDocs, Discord Source, or an invite to the Discord Source server is sent.</li>
  <li>Makes links to BetterDocs and Discord Source non-clickable.</li>
  <li>Blocks their theme preview system.</li>
  <li>Prevents the creator of the website (0mniscient/Mr. Robot) from using your theme.</li>

  <p class="answer">You can also customize the blockers look, making it fit your theme.</p>
<br>
</br>
  <h2 class="question">Why is BetterDiscordLibrary safe but Discord Source isn't?</h2>
  <p class="answer">Although BetterDiscordLibrary isn't associated with BetterDiscord themselfs, it is a safe source because the owner (Gibbu) only posts content that has already been featured on the BD server and always asks for permission to post. If Discord Source did that, we would have no problem with it.</p>
<br>
</br>
  <h2 class="question">How can I help against this?</h2>
  <p class="answer">If you have little knowledge in CSS/JS, then you can help by telling anyone you see who is using these sources about it's danger. If you do have some programming experience, you can join our server (link at the top bar), and help with the development of the blocker. If you are a theme developer, you can help by including the blocker in your themes.</p>
